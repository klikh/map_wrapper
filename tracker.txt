FEATURE REQUESTS:
* Deferred initialization of engine. Don't initialize all engines on startup, initialize an engine on the engine select.
* Add ability to customize switch controls: style, position, using own implementation.
* Add wrapper to handle map events.
* addEngine and selectEngine not only by the Engine object, but also but its codename: mw.selectEngine('yandex')
* Rename all really private variables (which won't be needed by Engine implementators or else) to something less obvious: add "_" before the name.
* Add event: selecting another engine.

BUGS:

DONE:
0.5 - Make MapWrapper interface more expandable to let user select its own engine.
